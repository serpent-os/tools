# - On systems that do not use lld as the system linker (such as Solus) using lld directly saves about a second 
# of build time for incremental compiles for building boulder (from 2.191s to 1.198s on my machine).
# - Compressing debug symbols with zstd shrinks the dev profile boulder binary from 206.03MB to 81.44MB, a 124.59MB
# or ~60% savings. It doesn't affect the binary size for packaging builds since we strip those, but the debug symbols
# are reduced in size from 113.16MB to 34.63MB. It adds about ~152ms to the build times which is less than we gained 
# by switching to lld
# - The new symbol mangling format (https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/symbol-mangling/v0.html) improves the backtrace
# shown by RUST_BACKTRACE=1 and other debug utilities. It should also be helpful once we have ABI reports. Upstream
# hasn't switched to it yet by default due to stable distros not having new enough tools, but that doesn't matter for us
